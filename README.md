shout-desk
==========

Shout Desk is a - Responsive one page Web applications. I coded it using Foundation framework prior to bootstrap popularity.
It was a complex CSS coding as the user interface was so much sophisticated comprising with some current design trend.

You may have a look at the demo LIVE page here: http://amitmojumder.net/demo/shout-desk/ShoutDesk1/

The responsiveness is now with some bugs which means its not 100% responsive.

Reason:
>> The project was at the very early stage of responsive web design trends.
>> Time allowed for this project was so tight that, client just had accepted this buggy responsive code informing me that
 they would sort that out by their in-house team at the time of CMS integration.
